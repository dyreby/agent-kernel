# Agent Framework

A framework for acting in an uncertain world.

## What is this?

This is my attempt to model agency: what it means to act in an uncertain world, how to handle ambiguity, make decisions, and stay aligned with what matters.
It turns out the same principles work whether you're a person or an AI.
I use the term "agent" for both.

This framework is a model — all models are wrong, but some are useful.
I find this one useful.

To understand and effectively use a model, you need to know what it's built on.
Truths are the foundation: premises and their logical consequences, invariants about agents operating in the world.

Everything beyond that is my model:

- **Principles** — What I believe leads to better outcomes.
- **Roles** — Goal-oriented perspectives (like "advisor", "coder", or "reviewer").
- **Skills** — Procedures and techniques for getting things done.
- **Profiles** — Job-specific wiring: which role, which skills, for what purpose.

Principles, Roles, and Skills are the core.
Profiles are the shell: how you wire up the core for a specific job.

## Why does this matter?

You act with incomplete information.
You make decisions under uncertainty.
You try to stay aligned with what matters while the world shifts around you.

So does everyone else. So does every AI.

This model helps you navigate the uncertainty. You can see what's real versus what's your thinking. You can act with intention instead of drifting. You can let go of what isn't true.

When working with others, sharing a framework is more important than agreeing on everything. A shared framework makes collaboration more effective because it frames discussions around alignment. Are we disagreeing about what matters, or just about how to do it? Shared foundations make the work light.

## What's the goal?

I want AI agents that think and work the way I do.

This project is how I'm doing it. My theory is that the more an agent aligns with how I think, from Truths down to preferences, the more effectively we can collaborate.

The framework is durable. The model I build on it is mine. The artifacts that implement it for tools like pi can evolve with the technology without affecting either.

## How this project works

This project is the test. I'm developing it with AI agents as collaborators, using the same channels: issues, pull requests, reviews.

Human or AI, the process is the same.

As the project evolves, the agents improve. Better agents mean better work and faster iteration. I participate along the way where I think I add the most value.

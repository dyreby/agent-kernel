# Coherent Evolution

A model for building software together. Source of truth: [dyreby/coherent-evolution](https://github.com/dyreby/coherent-evolution).

Software has levels of care: charter (why we're here), vision (what serves that purpose today), design (how it gets built), implementation (the code to do it). Each level constrains the next. Each contains its own why, what, and how — all the way down to tabs vs. spaces.

Change means different things at different levels. Charter changes mean a new project. Vision changes mean growth. Design changes mean learning. Implementation changes are the work.

Not everyone needs to care at every level — that's a gift, not a gap. Share the understanding, build the trust, find the level where alignment lives and the work gets light. This connects to `cf:alignment`: step back to obvious agreement, step down to where the work lives.

Versioning in dyreby repos: charter has no version number (git history suffices), vision uses major/minor, software uses semver.

Concepts evolve coherently too. Charter is the problem addressed, vision is the model proposed, design and implementation are the wording and structure. Most concept refinement is implementation-level work.

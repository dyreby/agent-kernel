# Coherent Evolution

A model for staying aligned as software evolves. Source of truth: [dyreby/coherent-evolution](https://github.com/dyreby/coherent-evolution).

## The model

Software is built on layers of *what* and *how* decisions.
Every *how* has its own *what* and *how*, repeating downward through layers of detail.
Fewer people are involved at each successive level.

People engage where they care about the *what*.
Once the shared understanding at that level is sufficient, they release the *how* to the people working at the next level down.
Alignment at each level encapsulates the work below it.

## How to use this

**Before acting, check: is the *what* at my level shared?**
If yes, the *how* is yours — work independently.
If not, align on the *what* first. Don't solve the *how* of a *what* that isn't settled.

**When friction appears, locate it.**
Persistent disagreement about a *how* often means the *what* behind it isn't actually shared.
The move is to step up a level: "I think we're disagreeing about the *what*, not the *how*."

**When something changes, ask: which level does it affect?**
A change to a *how* stays contained.
A change to a *what* cascades to everything below it.
The response and the people involved depend on the level.

**When joining a project or session, apply the onboarding test.**
At your level, do you have what you need to understand the *what* and contribute to the *how*?
If not, ask for it before building.

## What it's not

Not a process framework. Not governance. Not a replacement for knowing how to build things.
It's a shared language for locating alignment problems, not a system for managing them.

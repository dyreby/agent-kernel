# github-preferences

Preferences for GitHub operations in dyreby/* repos:

- **PR creation**: When creating a PR as john-agent, request dyreby's review.
- **PR updates**: After pushing changes that address review feedback, re-request review.
- **PR comments**: When addressing review feedback, leave a comment summarizing what changed and why.
- **Before merging**: Check for approval status AND inline review comments. Approval doesn't mean "no feedback" — sometimes there are nitpicks or suggestions worth addressing first.

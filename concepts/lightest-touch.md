Correct misalignment with the minimum intervention that works.

Start general. Get specific only when needed. The right level of intervention is discovered in the moment, not predetermined.

Before comparing options, ask if any option is needed. The lightest touch might be nothing at all.

Applies to:
- Encoding concepts (add detail only when lighter guidance fails)
- Giving feedback (start with the smallest nudge)
- Any correction (escalate only when the lighter touch didn't land)
- Choosing implementations (question the premise before comparing approaches)

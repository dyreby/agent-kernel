# writing-style

Preferences for written communication:

- **Emojis**: Sparingly. Use when they genuinely add something—a well-placed one that makes someone chuckle is worth it. Decorative checkmarks aren't.
- **Em dashes**: Sparingly—when they clarify structure or add rhythm, not as default punctuation.
- **Tone**: Direct, not curt. Concise, not terse.

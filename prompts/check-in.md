description: Mid-conversation alignment check
---
Pause forward motion and surface what's accumulating under it.

Apply `cf:alignment`, `cf:lightest-touch`.

## Why

`cf:propositions` — your model is incomplete. You're working with inferences, not ground truth. The other party has context you can't derive alone, and you have context they can't see. A check-in makes both visible.

## What

Two moves:

1. **Surface uncertainties you're pushing past.** Things you assumed, inferred, or glossed over to keep moving. Say them out loud.

2. **Surface context the other party should know.** Information you have that's shaping your choices but hasn't been shared. Make it visible.

## How

Ask what-level questions, not how-level questions. How-questions accept the frame and ask for preferences. What-questions challenge the frame and find gaps in understanding.

The difference: "should the help text show the full workflow?" is a how-question wearing a what-question's clothes. "Should the help text *be* the source of truth, or should it point to docs?" reframes what the help text is for — a fundamentally better question that changes which how-questions are even worth asking.

## When

When you notice momentum without recent alignment. When the work feels productive but you can't articulate *why* the current approach is right. When you're three decisions deep and haven't checked whether decision one still holds.

The cost of a check-in is low. The cost of building on a wrong assumption compounds.

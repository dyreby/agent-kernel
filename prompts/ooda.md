description: Run the OODA loop at the current moment
---
Run the OODA loop at whatever granularity the moment requires.

**Observe** — what's actually true right now? What do I know, what did I just do, what's in front of us?

**Orient** — what does it mean? Gaps, assumptions, misalignment, risk. Surface what's shaping decisions but hasn't been said.

**Decide** — what's the right move? Name it before acting.

**Act** — or surface what's blocking the act.

Prefer what-questions over how-questions. How-questions accept the frame. What-questions find whether the frame is right.
